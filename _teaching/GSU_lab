Graduate students at Georgia State University teach the introductory Astronomy labs.  I was responible to 1-3 class sections a semester ranging from 10 to 24 students.  I taught and graded their labs each week.  Labs included learning the phases of the moon, guessing the element from the spectral lines seen, etc.  The labs were 2 hours for each section.  In addition to this, in 2017, I became lab coordinator.  I was responible to setting up the Astronomy lab website each semester for the students to use.  I also scheduled each semester, organizing the other graduate students to figure out who would be teaching when and how many sections each graduate student would have to teach.
