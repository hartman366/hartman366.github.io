## Research experience
---

**2015 - Present**<br>
Graduate Research<br>
I am developing a new optimal method for using photometric data in BAO analyses. I am also part of the HSC LSS analysis being undertaken by the LSST DESC LSS working group.<br>

**2014**<br>
Graduate Research<br>
I was working on a project for modeling the light curves of rotating neutron stars.

**2013-2014**<br>
Undergraduate Research<br>
This project was working on finding the volume complete metallicity distribution function for low mass stars (M and K dwarfs) in SDSS. The part I was involved with was specifically being able to model the temperature given colors from SDSS, later extended to also model metallicity and use colors also from 2MASS and WISE.<br>

**2012**<br>
Undergraduate Research<br>
I was involved with testing front end detectors for upgrades to the CMS detector on LHC.
