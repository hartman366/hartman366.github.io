Graduate student. PhD candidate. Cosmologist. Red panda enthusiast. Black belt. Amateur musician.

## Professional

I worked on a project in undergrad callibrating a color-temperature-metallicity relation for SDSS to search for low-metallicity M dwarfs. The work was done with Dr. Jennifer Johnson and Dr. Sarah Schmidt, and resulted in both my undergraduate thesis as well as a paper updating my results with a second year of data.

My main project currently is working on an optimal method for using redMaGiC galaxies in studying baryon acoustic oscillations with my advisor, Dr. Eduardo Rozo. Explain some stuff here.

I am also involved in a project with the LSST DESC large scale structure working group to analyze data from HSC. My portion of this is working on a way to get systematics maps from single exposure information. I am collaborating with Dr. David Alonso on this project.


## Personal
I studied karate for 6 years while in grade school, and attained the rank of third degree black belt. In addition to this, I was an instructor, especially for the kid's program at my karate school. I'm currently looking to start up some form of martial arts again.

I love music, and I play flute, piccolo, and some piano. I am also actively involved with my church music program, as a member of both the adult handbell choir and the chancel choir, in which I sing second soprano.

I am an occaisonal knitter, although I always feel guilty that I don't spend more time on it.

Red pandas are my favorite animal ever! They are just so adorable, especially sleeping in a tree using their tails as a blanket. My boyfriend and I enjoy traveling to different zoos (especially with red pandas), and we have also done a wildlife encounter with them. I donate/ask for people to make donation in my name to the red panda network, and think it would be awesome to go on one of their eco-trips in the future.
