excerpt: Over the past decade, the number of known wide-binary systems has expanded exponentially, thanks to the release of data from the Gaia Mission. Some of these wide-binary systems are actually higher-order multiples, where one of the components is an unresolved binary itself. One way to search for these systems is by identifying the overluminous components in the systems. In this study, we examine 4947 K+K wide-binary pairs from the SUPERWIDE catalog, and quantify the relative colors and luminosities of the components to find evidence for additional unresolved companions. The method is best illustrated in a graph that we call the "Lobster" diagram. To confirm that the identified overluminous components are close binary systems, we cross-match our wide binaries with the TESS, K2, and Kepler archives, and search for signs of eclipses and fast stellar rotation modulation in the light curves. We find that 78.9% ± 20.7% of the wide binaries that contain an eclipsing system are identified as overluminous in the "Lobster" diagram, and that 73.5% ± 12.4% of the wide binaries that contain a component showing fast rotation (P < 5 days) also show an overluminous component. From these results, we calculate a revised lower limit on the higher-order multiplicity fraction for K+K wide binaries of 40.0% ± 1.6%. We also examine the higher-order multiplicity fraction as a function of projected physical separation and metallicity. The fraction is unusually constant as a function of projected physical separation, while we see no statistically significant evidence that the fraction varies with metallicity.
